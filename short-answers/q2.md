What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer
## What are nodes?
    Node represents anything inside a HTML file : 
    span, div, comments, text
    
### Whats a NodeList?
___
A `NodeList` returns all of the nodes, which are text, comments, HTML elements



***ALSOO*** `NodeList` can easily be converted into array with spread operator to be able to have all JavaScript array method functionality (found this in the comments)

## What are elements?
    Elements are only HTML elements. A special type of a node. 
    
    Elements are what you are going to use, only because you don't really need the comments. 
    
    They are nodes but just the tags basically

### What is a HTML collection?
___
An `HTMLCollection` is a list of DOM elements that match certain criteria. Very similar to a NodeList , only accessing the elements
