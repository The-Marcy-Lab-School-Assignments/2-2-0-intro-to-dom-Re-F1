# Question
When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer
You can also insert HTML directly using `.innerHTML` but you should be very careful about doing this. Only ever do this if the content you are adding is hard-coded (not user-generated).

But you would use `.innerHTML` if you want to change/update. 
And you would use .createElement to create some new HTML
